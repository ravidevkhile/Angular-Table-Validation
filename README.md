# TableValidation

Reactive Forms in Angular: Dynamically Creating Form Fields  and field Validation from JSON.
Playing with table is always fun in Angular. Many times user want to add or update record in the table through user interactive/inline editable table with validation. To achieve this we can use Angular dynamic form controls.

So you have a table and would like to add form fields and validate them dynamically from a api responce(JSON)? It’s easy to do with Reactive Forms and FormArray. FormArray is a bit like FormGroup and it’s used in a very similar way, the difference being that it’s used as an array that wraps around an arbitrary amount of FormControl, FormGroup or even other FormArray instances.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
